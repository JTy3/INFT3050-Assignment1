# INFT3050 Web Programming Assignment

A Web Application built by Jacob Tye for INFT3050.

`release/assig-1` - Will be the branch for assignment 1

Master will be merged into for whatever assignment is due next. 

So if you are here to mark just use master :)

## Getting Started

To run this locally you will need the following:

- Microsoft Visual Studio (I developed this in 2019 but I really don't see a reason why it wouldn't run in earlier versions)
- IIS Express
- Microsoft SQL Server
- SQL Server Management Studio (Not essential, but will help visualise the DB)

If requested I might deploy this to an Azure Instance but we will see.

## Steps 
### First Step

Clone the repo or unzip the zip file

`git clone https://github.com/EminenceAus/INFT3050`

### Second Step

Open Solutions file, this will open in your version of Microsoft VS Code

`c3304972-Assig1.sln`

### Third Step

Load in DB to MSQL Server

> TBC On this process, easy enough to do manually but I might write and automation script to make it fail safe

### Fourth Step 

Click Start and have fun!
